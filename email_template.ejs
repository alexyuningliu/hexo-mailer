    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= monthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
      my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Check out my latest posts from the last 60 days here: 
      <ul>
      <% for(var i = 0; i < latestPosts.length; i++) { %>
        <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].link.href %>>Title: <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>
      <% } %>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Talk soon,<br>
